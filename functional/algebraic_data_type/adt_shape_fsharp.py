""" Python Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

    `Shape` example from `F# For Fun and Profit`

    Pattern matching with union types
    https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/key-concepts.html

    In the following example, we create a Shape type
    representing four different shapes and
    then define a draw function with different behavior
    for each kind of shape.

    This is similar to polymorphism in an object oriented language,
    but based on functions.
